Install the new dependencies in frontend and backend
Create the routes in app.jsx
the routes are
- / which will show a login page
/contacts which will show the main contacts app
/register which will show a registration page
/not-authorized which will show a 403 error if a user is not authorized and wants to enter /private page
"*" if the route does not exist
4) user model to be stored on a new collection table on our contacts db
5) On the backend: We need to handle all the login/registration
6) We need to create a login page, registration page, not authorized page, and not found page
7) We need to edit contacts app to show the username up top of the page
